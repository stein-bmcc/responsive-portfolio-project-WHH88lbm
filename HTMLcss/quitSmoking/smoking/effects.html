     <h1>The effects of smoking</h1>
      <p>Short-Term Effects</p>
        <br>
        <p>You will start to notice some changes right away as soon as you use cigarettes.Your fingers will yellow, your breath and hair and clothes will smell like smoke, and your teeth will stain.You may also develop a hacking cough and suffer many of the symptoms of allergies, such as a runny nose, fever, itchiness and mucous buildup.
        Maybe none of those sound too bad to you, but the effects of smoking are just beginning at that point. Over time, you will start to notice a lack of athletic ability, as your lung capacity diminishes and you have a harder time staying active. You will also see blood pressure increases and throat irritability.</P>

        <p>Long-Term Effects</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over time, all the problems above become much worse. Let’s start with the least awful problems.
        The staining on your hands and teeth will worsen. Your fingers will start to shake when you need a cigarette. The cravings will be much more intense the longer you go without a cigarette; getting near others who are smoking or smell like smoke can also trigger cravings easily. What was once an enjoyable habit has become a necessity.You will also notice that your breathing may have become more ragged. That’s because scar tissue is building up in through throat and lungs. Your entire respiratory system is breaking down because of the smoking habit. That scar tissue means the cancer is probably in your future. You can look forward to dealing with lung, throat and mouth cancer. You won’t have to deal with them for very long though, as they can lead to death.
        If they don’t cause you to die, then you will at least need to have sections of your throat, mouth, and lungs removed. Mechanical replacements can be used instead, but they won’t be pleasant to deal with.</p>
