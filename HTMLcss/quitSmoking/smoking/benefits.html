     <h1>The benefits of quitting</h1>
       
       <p>The chances of having a stroke reduces to half of that of a non-smoker in 2 years, and the same as a non-smoker in 5 years.

       <br>Risks for cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder drop by half within 5 years. The risk for lung cancer drops by half after 10 years.

       <br>A year after quitting smoking, the risk of a heart attack is reduced by half. After 15 years, it is the same as someone who has never smoked.

       <br>Overall, once someone stops smoking, their health will improve and their body will begin to recover.</p>
